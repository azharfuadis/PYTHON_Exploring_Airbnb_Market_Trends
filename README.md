# PYTHON_Exploring_Airbnb_Market_Trends
Apply your importing and cleaning data and data manipulation skills to explore New York City Airbnb data.

**Project Description**
New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations.

As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.

There are three files in the data folder: 
1. airbnb_price.csv
2. airbnb_room_type.xlsx
3. airbnb_last_review.tsv

To do:
1. What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.
   
2. How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.
   
3. What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.
   
4. Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.
